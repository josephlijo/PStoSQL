# PStoSQL
PowerShell to SQL App

# Objective
Main purpose of this script is to: 
* Help us with little modifications understand how we can connect to a SQL Server database and run a query (or stored procedure) against it. 
* Script also include logic to export the data to an Excel File.
* There are bat files included, which can be used to connect to different database instance for example with different parameter sets

# Instructions
1. Make sure that the parameter set is matching your requirement. You should modify the parameter - SQLServer - to point it to a valid instance
2. (Optional) Use any of the *.bat files and modify the parameters there rather than in the *ps1 file
